### MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium

MUNGE (_MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium_) is an authentication service for
creating and validating credentials.  It is designed to be highly scalable
for use in an HPC cluster environment.  It allows a process to authenticate
the UID and GID of another local or remote process within a group of hosts
having common users and groups.  These hosts form a security realm that is
defined by a shared cryptographic key.  Clients within this security realm
can create and validate credentials without the use of root privileges,
reserved ports, or platform-specific methods.
